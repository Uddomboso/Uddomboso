I'm a web developer with a good frontend and backend skills.

languages: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Java ( building projects from scratch, fixing bugs, or cleaning up messy code when needed.)

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into Python, working on a personal project that is user friendly and has AI integration.

My focus: getting things to work, clean code, solid structure, and especially keeping the user in mind.
