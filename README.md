I'm a full stack web developer with a growing interest in desktop application development. I work with:

Languages: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and Java

Lately, I've been diving into Python, working on a personal project that is both user friendly and features AI integration.

My focus: keeping the structure solid, the code clean, and the experience smooth for the user.
